This repository contains a complete Inventory and Order Management System developed in C++, built with a strong focus on simplicity, clarity, and practical application. It is designed for students, beginners, or anyone exploring how to combine core programming concepts to create a real, functioning software solution. The system uses only standard C++ libraries such as <iostream>, <fstream>, <sstream>, and <string>, making it portable and easy to compile on any environment where a standard C++ compiler is available.

The project covers two major areas: Inventory Management and Order Processing. The inventory module allows adding new products, updating product quantities and prices, deleting products, and displaying all available products in the system. Each product includes fields such as an ID, product name, quantity, and price. All this information is stored persistently inside a CSV file named Inventory.csv, which the program automatically reads when it starts. This ensures that no data is lost between runs, and users can continuously manage products without manually handling files.

The order handling component provides users the ability to place orders by referencing products from the inventory. It automatically checks for product availability, calculates total prices, deducts ordered quantities from stock, and saves each order to Orders.csv. Every stored order includes an order ID, product ID, product name, unit price, total price, quantity, and the order status. At the moment, all new orders default to a “Pending” status, but the system is designed so that more statuses like “Shipped,” “Delivered,” and “Cancelled” can be integrated later.

This version is intentionally built using arrays to help beginners understand the logic clearly before moving on to dynamic structures like vectors or object-oriented programming. File parsing is done using stringstream to efficiently split CSV data into usable values.

While the project is currently backend-only and console-based, I plan to expand it significantly. In future updates, this repository will include a frontend interface, most likely built with modern web technologies. The system will then be fully connected end-to-end, transforming this C++ backend into a complete, user-friendly inventory and order management application.
